Our primary goal was to demonstrate how the voting preferences of U.S. legislators (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents) have shifted over time particularly in response to major historical events, contributing to periods of political polarization. We examined legislative votes on key defense policies related to "Foreign and Defense Policy support" Clausen category, focusing on periods before, during and after notable conflicts. Using Voteview’s data, we visualized each legislator's ideological position, represented by their proximity on a two-dim liberal-conservative spectrum.

In this project, Voteview assigns coordinates to each legislator based on their voting history:
Socio-Economic Dimension (X): Reflects the historical left vs right or liberal (progressist) vs conservative.
Socio-Cultural Dimension (Y): Captures pivotal issues relevant at the time of voting, often encompassing race, civil rights and cultural identity.

World War II:
A clear partisan divide emerged with Democrats clustering to the left, reflecting a stronger liberal position on both economic and social issues, while Republicans were more distributed on the conservative right. Post-war, while divisions persisted, some convergence appeared in the center indicating moments of bipartisan agreement on certain policies.

Vietnam War:
Polarization was less pronounced than in WWII, with greater overlap between parties on defense matters. This reflects the complex nature of the Vietnam conflict, with legislators showing varied positions on intervention, military strategy and foreign policy.

Afghanistan:
In the periods surrounding the invasion, polarization became sharper again, with a conservative shift in defense and national security policy. Republicans dominated the right side of the plot, reflecting a strong conservative stance, while Democrats remained largely on the left highlighting ideological divides on these issues.
