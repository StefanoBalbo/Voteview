Our main purpose was to illustrate how the preferences of U.S. legislators, including Democrats, Republicans and Independents, have evolved in response to significant historical events, leading to situations of political polarization. To achieve this, we focused on a select set of relevant wars and evaluated their votes on defense laws, specifically in the category of "Foreign and Defense Policy support," analyzing their preferences in periods that encompassed before, during and even after each armed conflict. The graphs display an indicator constructed by voteview.com, that represents the degree of liberalism (closer to the origin) or conservatism (further away) expressed by candidates at each moment, both in social and economic aspects.

The Voteview platform assigns coordinates to each legislator based on their voting history, reflecting their position on the liberal-conservative spectrum. The coordinates used in this project are two-dimensional.
Economic Dim (X axis): Indicates the degree of economic liberalism versus conservatism.
Social Dim (Y axis): Represents social liberalism versus conservatism.
This allows us to measure the polarity in the legislative voting behavior and understand how divided or united legislators were on defense issues during each period.

World War II:
Clear division between Republicans and Democrats. Before, the Democrats tend to cluster on the left side of the spectrum, indicating a stronger liberal stance on both social and economic dimensions. Republicans, by contrast, were more distributed on the right. After, the division between the two parties remains visible, but there is some overlap in the middle, indicating possible agreement or some convergence on some policies.

Vietnam War:
Polarization appears less stark compared to WWII. There is greater overlap, suggesting more shared positions between the parties, at least in the context of defense policies.
The Vietnam War is considered a complex conflict and the ideological positions of legislators reflected the intricated national debate on intervention, military strategy and foreign policy.

Afghanistan:
Before and after the invasion, the graphs show a return to clearer polarization. This period was marked by a surge in conservative policies, especially on defense and national security, with Republicans dominating right side of the plot.
