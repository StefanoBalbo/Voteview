## Our primary goal was to demonstrate how the voting preferences of U.S. legislators (Democrats, Republicans, Independents) have shifted over time particularly in response to major historical events, contributing to periods of political polarization. We examined legislative votes on key defense policies related to "Foreign and Defense Policy support" Clausen category, focusing on periods before, during and after notable conflicts. We visualized each legislator's ideological position, represented by their proximity on a two-dim liberal-conservative spectrum.

[Voteview](https://voteview.com/) assigns coordinates to each legislator based on their voting history:

Socio-Economic Dimension (X): Reflects the historical left vs right or liberal (progressist) vs conservative.
Socio-Cultural Dimension (Y): Captures pivotal issues relevant at the time of voting, often encompassing race, civil rights and cultural identity.

Historical events considered:

World War II
Vietnam War
Afghanistan Invasion
