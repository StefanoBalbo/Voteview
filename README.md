# Voteview_Plots
 Sharing with Political Economy students some results and opportunities offered by the analysis of the voteview.com database. https://sfreille.github.io/teaching/epol

Our main purpose was to illustrate how the preferences of U.S. legislators, including Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, have evolved in response to significant historical events, leading to situations of political polarization. To achieve this, we focused on a select set of relevant wars and evaluated their votes on defense laws, specifically in the category of "Foreign and Defense Policy support," analyzing their preferences in periods that encompassed before, during, and even after each armed conflict. 

The graphs display an indicator constructed by Voteview, that represents the degree of liberalism (closer to the origin) or conservatism (further away) expressed by candidates at each moment, both in social and economic aspects.
